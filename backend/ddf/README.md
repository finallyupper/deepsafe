The Dual Shield for Deepfake Security  

## Introduction
The misuse of deepfake technology poses serious security threats, such as identity theft. DeepSafe is a defense system that employs an Adversarial Robust Watermarking technique to disrupt face-swapping models while enabling image source tracking. Based on the [Dual Defense framework](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10486948), this system utilizes the Original-domain Feature Emulation Attack (OFEA) method to embed an invisible watermark, preventing face swapping while ensuring identity traceability.
